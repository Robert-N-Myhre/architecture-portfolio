# Repository guidance — Independent Technology Research

This is the source of a public **independent technology research** site built with MkDocs Material and published at https://robert-n-myhre.github.io/architecture-portfolio/.

## Purpose and boundaries

Publish explorations initiated by personal curiosity about technologies, systems, and architectural questions. Keep the public presentation focused on the research question, investigation, evidence, and limitations. Avoid résumé-style achievements, promotional language, and organizational delivery narratives.

Before including new material, verify that it originated in an independently initiated investigation rather than an employer- or client-directed engagement. Do not fictionalize provenance. Enterprise technology can be an independent research subject.

A project may be experimental, prototype-driven, architectural, or purely conceptual. Implementation is **not** a publication requirement. Preserve research questions, evolving assumptions, negative results, abandoned avenues, and genuine uncertainties. Distinguish clearly between design intent, hypothesis, observed data, prototype validation, and production validation. Never describe a proposed control as proven or a prototype as a deployment.

Write for technically curious readers who have no previous project context. Prefer clear questions, evidence, limitations, and what changed over claims of impact or seniority. Avoid forcing varied research into a rigid template.

## Navigation and content

- `mkdocs.yml` owns site navigation; pages need appropriate nav entries to appear.
- `docs/projects/` holds investigations.
- `docs/reference-architectures/` holds research-derived and conceptual architecture artifacts; label their maturity.
- `docs/research-methodology.md` describes evidence and publication principles.
- `docs/assets/` contains visual assets and CSS; preserve assets used by active pages.
- `overrides/` contains Material theme overrides.

Maintain existing public investigation URLs unless there is a compelling reason to change them. Do not change deployed content silently if status, evidence, or scope changes.

## Preview and build

```bash
mkdocs serve
mkdocs build --strict
```

The `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` workflow deploys on pushes to `main`. Prefer a reviewable PR for broad content changes. Verify internal links and images after restructuring.
