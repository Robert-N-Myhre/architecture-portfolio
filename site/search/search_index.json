Anticipating tomorrow.\""},{"location":"about/#about-me","title":"About Me","text":"<p>I've spent my career architecting infrastructure that doesn't just connect systems but connects teams, priorities, and business outcomes. While I\u2019ve worn many hats across networking, security, and cloud, what consistently drives me is solving complex problems in practical, scalable ways, especially when it means enabling others do their best work.</p> <p>My path started in hands-on engineering, eventually earning my CCIE and leading enterprise-class network builds. But over time, I found I was just as passionate about how teams adopt technology as the technology itself. I\u2019ve helped design data centers, multi-cloud environments, segmentation strategies, and automation frameworks. More importantly, I\u2019ve helped engineers and leaders navigate change with clarity and confidence.</p> <p>I specialize in networking, but I never approach problems in isolation. I work closely with adjacent teams to understand their needs, constraints, and objectives, because a successful architecture serves more than just the network. I'm always trying to solve for the bigger picture: aligning design decisions with business priorities, anticipating growth, and designing with future evolution in mind. Whether it\u2019s understanding where quantum computing, quantum networking, or the Internet of Bodies may intersect with infrastructure, I aim to stay ahead, not just current.</p> <p>I value clean, repeatable architectures. I believe vendor-neutral doesn't mean vendor-averse. I prefer asking the right questions over assuming the right answers. And I\u2019m always thinking about how today\u2019s decisions set the tone for what comes next.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe in the idea of job security through gatekeeping. Architects and engineers should never make themselves indispensable by withholding knowledge.  We should make ourselves valuable by staying adaptable, sharing freely, and growing alongside the technologies we support.</p> <p>When I\u2019m not designing infrastructure, I\u2019m often building internal communities, mentoring engineers, organizing working groups, or just encouraging quiet voices to speak up. Because great architecture isn\u2019t built in isolation\u2014it\u2019s built with people.</p> <p>Above all, I\u2019m a lifelong learner. Staying at the forefront of technology requires curiosity, humility, and a willingness to evolve. That mindset has kept me moving forward and helping others do the same.</p>"},{"location":"architectural-philosophy/","title":"My Architectural Philosophy","text":"<p>Architecture is more than just design patterns or documentation.

Complexity breaks. I look for elegant, minimal solutions that solve the root problem\u2014not just patch the symptoms.</li> <li>Architecture is a handoff, not a handcuff. My goal is to build solutions that are easy to adopt, operate, and evolve, even after I\u2019ve moved on.</li> <li>Best-of-breed over default stacks. I don\u2019t chase logos. I align tools with business goals, operational maturity, team readiness, budget, and long term sustainability.</li> <li>Repeatable patterns, not one-off heroics - I favor patterns and frameworks that can be reused and extended, not just clever one-time builds that solve a single use case.</li> <li>Clarity over cleverness. Documentation and design artifacts should help others support the system, not decipher it.</li> <li>Think big-picture. Design with context.

While technically feasible, that approach doesn't scale well and rarely earns lasting buy-in. I believe in collaborative decision-making, shared ownership, and ensuring that the teams who will live with the solution are part of shaping it.</p> <p>My favorite engagements are those where I get to bring people along; mentoring, listening, and building consensus as much as building designs.</p>"},{"location":"architectural-philosophy/#looking-forward","title":"Looking Forward","text":"<p>I don\u2019t believe architecture is a one-time effort.
